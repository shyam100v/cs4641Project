<p>YouTube is an online video-sharing platform with billions of users, posting and watching content for entertainment and education. YouTube monetizes popular videos for the number of views as it increases the use and popularity of the platform itself. With our project, we hope to provide insights on how to make a video trend on YouTube and predict the popularity of a video given certain features.</p>
<h2>
<a id="dataset" class="anchor" href="#dataset" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dataset:</h2>
<p>-&gt; <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new">https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new</a> <br>
This dataset includes several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Data includes the video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count for up to 200 trending videos per day for several regions. More information like the channel’s age, channel's video count, and subscriber count have been added using the YouTube API. From this dataset, we will only be using the USA's, Canada's, and Great Britain's trending video data.</p>
<h3>
<a id="youtube-api" class="anchor" href="#youtube-api" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>YouTube API</h3>
<p>We also augment the available data with our own data scavenged from YouTube using its APIs. We wrote a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/youtubeCrawl.ipynb">script</a> to fetch the top 200 trending videos from USA, Canada and Great Britain everyday for roughly a month. In addition, the channel information was also fetched and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/combiningData.ipynb">compiled</a> with the data from Kaggle.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Languages</strong>: Youtube fosters content from all around the world in numerous languages. We discard video entries in the dataset that do not have English titles to easier analyze the data.</li>
<li>
<strong>Handling duplicates</strong>: Several videos are in trending charts for multiple days. In order to not skew the data, we retain only one copy of each video with the highest number of views.</li>
<li>
<strong>Null entries</strong>: We have also removed videos with ratings disables and comments disabled.</li>
<li>
<strong>Handling dates and time</strong>: We parse the dates and times in YouTube's native format to formats suitable for machine learning algorithms (floats and integets)</li>
<li>
<strong>Handling outliers</strong>: To gain insights for a majority of the data, outliers were removed using hard thresholds and by using the mean and standard deviation.</li>

<a id="principal-component-analysispca" class="anchor" href="#principal-component-analysispca" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Principal Component Analysis(PCA)</h2>
<p>We selected some properties from original video dataset as features of videos, including trending rank, video category, number of views, likes, and dislikes, number of comments, publish time, and video channel related features. For features like duration of video and publish time, we preprocessed our data such that they are represented in the same unit(second) and in a 24-hour time scale.
We combined all 12 features into a training dataset and apply PCA. PCA was used to reduce the dimension of features through capturing variation. Here is the cumulative explained variance plot.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/pca_variance.PNG" alt="pca_variance"></p>
<p>From the plot, we can see that at 6 components, we will get a desired cumulative explained variance(0.9). We also made two component PCA scatter plots to give us some visualizations.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/pca_views.PNG" alt="pca_views">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/pca_dislikes.PNG" alt="pca_dislikes"></p>
<p>From the scatter plots, we do can see number of views, likes, and dislikes are correlated. Low number of views, low number of likes, and low number of dislikes are all clustered at the middle-left part of the graph.</p>
<h2>
<a id="dbscan" class="anchor" href="#dbscan" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DBSCAN</h2>
<p><strong>Publishing Times</strong><br>
Using DBSCAN clustering on the video views and publishing time features, we can see that the optimal time frame to publish videos on YouTube is from about 1:30 to 8:30 pm GMT; however, we did find many noise points and the clusters found were quite low in view count.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/dbscan_clusters.PNG" alt="dbscan_clusters"></p>
<p><strong>Video Titles</strong><br>
One of our main expected outcomes for the overall analysis of youtube videos was that video titles with similar characteristics to clickbait titles would have a higher view count. The main quantifiable characteristics that we seemed to find in all clickbait titles were capital letters and punctuation marks such as exlcamations points and question marks. We also figured that the length of the title could play a role as longer titles can give more information on the context of the videos. Using these three characteristics as a starting point, we manipulated our data to quanitfy these characteristics and then used DBSCAN to cluster them. Hopefully, we would be able to see clear clusters and relationships between the characteristics and the number of views. The below graphs are the results.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/Title_Length_DBSCAN.png" alt="title length dbscan"></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/Num_Caps_DBSCAN.png" alt="capital letters dbscan"></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/Num_Puncs_DBSCAN.png" alt="punctuation dbscan"></p>
<p>In the graph, the darkest purple points represent the outliers or, in other words, the points that did not fit into any cluster. We can see here that there actually a much smaller correlation between the view count of a video and its title's characteristics. The largest clusters in the first two graphs show that there is practically no relation between the length of the title or the number of capital letters in the title and the view count. But, when looking at the clusters at a higher view count, we can actually see a little of the opposite of our expected outcome. Instead of long video titles, we can see higher view count clusters aroung the midpoint in video titles and instead of having a lot of capital letters, we actually see clusters with less capital letters have a higher view count. Finally, with the punctuation marks, we can see that clusters with high view counts actually have on average little to no punctuation marks.</p>
<p>To conlcude our findings, we can see that the majority of videos do not rely on the characteristics of the video titles. For those that do have some correlation, we can see that the findings are the opposite of what we originally expected to see.</p>

<a id="linear-regression" class="anchor" href="#linear-regression" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Linear Regression</h2>
<p>First, an analysis of the correlation between different variables was performed. Looking at the first row, it is seen that only likes, dislikes and comment count are correlated with the number of views of a video.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/Correlation%20table.PNG" alt="Correlation table"></p>
<p>Then, a statistical summary of each of our variables was obtained. This analysis is useful to potentially identify any outliers in the data.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/max-min-std.PNG" alt="max-min-std"></p>
<p>Based on the table above, the data for the number of views, likes and dislikes was modified to remove any data points that were outside 2 standard deviations from their respective mean. Then, a basic histogram of the number of views, likes and dislikes was plotted. As it is appreciated on the graphs below, the three graphs are heavily skewed which is understandable — most common YouTubers probably won’t have that many views, likes and dislikes. Ideally, the data should resemble a Gaussian distribution. Luckily, a log tranformation can be applied to the number of views, likes and dislikes to achieve that.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/Number%20of%20views%20without%20logs.PNG" alt="Number of views without logs">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/Log%20number%20of%20views.PNG" alt="Log number of views"></p>
<p>Using this 3 histograms above, a linear regression of the log number of views versus the log number of likes and dislikes can be plotted. As expected, both correlations show an R^2 greater than 0.6, showing a big correlation between both the number of likes and dislikes and the number of views of a video. This analysis was only performed on these 2 variables since no other variables appear to correlate with the number of views of a video</p>

<h2>
<a id="multiple-regression" class="anchor" href="#multiple-regression" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Multiple Regression</h2>
<p>As we are trying to aid users in creating a popular Youtube video, we will look at one of the main features (excluding actual video content) that can manipulated by the video maker; the video title. Via Multiple Regression, we will use the quantifiable features of a video title to create a model that can predict the number of views a video will recieve based on it's title. In this case we will be looking at the length, number of capital letters, and number of exclamation and questions marks in the video title. Once again, we chose these parameters as they are common characteristics of clickbait titles, which are made exclusively for people to be attracted to.</p>
<p>First we loaded our data and calculated the needed parameters from the given titles. Now, a major hinderance with our original data was that there were a few drastic outliers in relation to the number of views a video had. In order to eliminate those, we removed any data points that were more than one standard deviation away from the mean (which was a very large standard deviation, so it was fitting to only use one). But even then, our data was very skewed. In order to have a balanced model, we would ideally like a Gaussian distribution, so we decided to take the log of the number of views, which did in fact give us a Gausian ditribution. The below graphs show the data distribution before and after applying the log function.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/MultReg_viewskew.png" alt="Views before log function"></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/MultReg_viewlog.png" alt="Views after log function"></p>
<p>Now that our data is better suited for analysis, we moved on to actually applying the regression model. Since we used three parameters (length, number of capital letters, and number of exclamation and queston marks) versus the number of views on a video, it would have resulted in a 3-dimensional model in a 4-dimensional space. As it is difficult to understand a 4-dimensional model, the following graphs show the regression models of just two parameters each versus the log of the number of views of the videos in order to give an overall picture.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/MultReg_lengthcapsreg.png" alt="length vs caps"></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/MultReg_lengthpuncsreg.png" alt="length vs puncs"></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/MultReg_capspuncsreg.png" alt="caps vs puncs"></p>
<p>As can be seen above, the grey plane in each of the graphs is the regression model that fits the set of data points the best. Since our data points are fairly spread out and do not show much correlation to the number of views, the fitted planes are relatively flat, and center ariund the area where most of the data points are in order to at least fit for a majority of videos.</p>
<p>Finally, to see how well our prediction model actually worked, we graphed a random set of data points that were used in our testing phase and compared them to their predictions.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/MultReg_predvsact.png" alt="predicted vs actual"></p>
<p>As we can see here, the model tends to predict within the 200000 to 400000 views range, and this is probably due to the very flat model that can be seen in the previous graphs. Though the model seems to overestimate the number of views for anything below 300000 views, it is actually proportional in a sense and predicts slighty less for those with less views and predicts slightly more for those with more views. Now, since it can be seen that the videos with a high number of views have very low predictions, we also calculated the error of the preditcions of videos with different ranges of views.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/MultReg_accuracy.png" alt="accuracy"></p>
<p>In the above graph, it can be seen that the lower the actual number of views a video has, the more accurate this model will be in its predictions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we see that the characteristics of a video title actually have a much smaller effect on the popularity of a video than we originally believed, especially on videos with extremely high view count. This is why this multiple regression model was so flat, because majority of videos actually have a relatively low view count no matter how they construct their video titles.</p>

<a id="gradient-boosting-regressor" class="anchor" href="#gradient-boosting-regressor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gradient Boosting Regressor</h2>
<p>Gradient Boosting Regressor is a form of tree ensemble model which builds an ensemble of weak predistion models. A new tree is trained at each step additively over the previous stage with the loss function as the residual error from previous stage.</p>
<p><strong>Model used</strong>: The <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html">sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor model</a> from sklearn module is used. The module also provides a method to visualize the <strong>importance of individual features</strong> after the model is trained. We use this to infer the most important contributors in predicting the number of views of a video (See <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/simpleDataAnalysis.ipynb">here</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Data Preparation</strong>: The data collected using the <strong>YouTube API</strong> is used to train and test the model with the logarithm of number of views of a video as the target label. Only the videos that have a view count between 1000 and 10 million are used. Sample of the data used is shown:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/dataSample1.png" alt="dataSample"></p>
<p><strong>Model performance and Feature importance</strong></p>
<p>With all the above listed features, the model has an RMSE of <strong>772445</strong> views. We infer from the plot that the number of likes and dislikes are the most important features in predicting the number of views.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/mdi1.png" alt="featureImportance1"></p>
<p>While this is intuitive, this does not serve as a good model for prediction since likes, dislikes, age of video and comments are not known in advance. After removing these features, the feature importance is plotted below:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyam100v/cs4641Project/master/image/mdi3.png" alt="featureImportance2"></p>
<p>It is seen that the channel subscriber count, the number of videos, total views on the channel, and age of the channel are the most important predictors.</p>
